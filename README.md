# Emotion Estimation using facial expression to Obtain Automatic Feedback of Customers


Facial expressions play an important role in detecting human emotions and current state of mind. Machine Learning can detect emotions by capturing facial expressions and learn what each expression means. This project is proposed to detect the customer feedback automatically with the help of the images/video captured through the surveillance camera using face emotion prediction. The images/videos can be captured in the entrance and exit of the showroom and with this image the customers facial expressions are recognised with the help of the machine learning/deep learning algorithms. The facial expression of the customers in the entrance and exit are happy then the customer is satisfied with the product or showroom which they visited. On the other hand, if the image in the entrance is happy and while exit it is different such as angry or disgust, we can conclude that the customer is unhappy. Based on this feedback remedial actions can be performed to improve the product.
